<h1 id="trip-report-autumn-iso-c-committee-meeting-wrocław-poland">Trip
Report: Autumn ISO C++ Committee Meeting (Wrocław, Poland)</h1>
<p><em>22 November 2024</em></p>
<p>The ISO C++ Standard Committee held its November 2024 meeting in
Wrocław, Poland. It’s an important meeting for C++26 as it’s the last
meeting for the Evolution Working Group to approve C++26 features
needing library response. This means that proposals having both core
language and standard library impact need to get either Evolution
Working Group (EWG) or Library Evolution Working Group (LEWG) approved
by the end of the Wrocław meeting to be included in C++26. For most of
the time, I was sitting in the Evolution Working Group as I am mostly
interested in language features that may impact compiler designs. Here
are some thoughts on some of the major discussions I have participated
in.</p>
<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p><a href="wg21.link/P2996">P2996</a> is a paper that progressed very
quickly through the previous three meetings. It was first seen in Kona
in November 2023. During the St. Louis meeting, the paper received
strong consensus to be forwarded to LWG and CWG for review. I am
personally very excited about this feature. It’s a transformative
feature for C++26 and will empower libraries to significantly improve
ergonomics for daily programming. (e.g. think about deriving
serialization, logging entire structs, and command line argument
parsing.)</p>
<p><a href="https://wg21.link/P3451">P3451</a>: The biggest open
question as a challenge to the status quo of <a
href="http://wg21.link/p2996">P2996</a> is whether reflection APIs like
<code>members_of</code> should respect accessibility. This was the main
argument in EWG on Wednesday.</p>
<ul>
<li>The libc++ maintainer voiced their concern about people depending on
reflection APIs to access private APIs in the standard library. However,
in practice, people do try to access standard library private APIs by
providing an alternative class declaration with friends.</li>
<li>I tried to propose to the libc++ author in the room that we can have
a second API with an alternative, potentially inconvenient spelling that
returns all members ignoring accessibility, because accessing
inaccessible members can be useful in cases like logging.</li>
<li>Arguments against an inconvenient spelling include the implied
unsafety of reflection, and that people should have no expectations on
portability.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, no consensus was reached whether we should make
inconvenient spellings for accessing private members. The general
feeling of the room is that we need to retain some form of access to
private and protected members.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-matching">Pattern Matching</h2>
<p>Pattern Matching is a feature seen in many functional languages that
provides very powerful and ergonomic control flow. Currently, it’s
extremely inconvenient to pattern match standard library constructs like
<code>std::variant&lt;Ts...&gt;</code> . As of C++23, people have to do
library tricks to emulate pattern matching that is nowhere nearly as
powerful and elegant. I believe there’s good reasons to be excited about
<a href="https://wg21.link/p2688">P2688</a>: Pattern Matching:
<code>match</code> Expression. Michael Park presented the paper in EWG
on Thursday morning where the committee made progress on the
discussions. There is consensus that we’d like to encourage more work on
Michael Park’s P2688 for C++26 inclusion.</p>
<p>There’s also an alternative proposal <a
href="https://wg21.link/P2392">P2392</a> by Herb Sutter to adopt ‘is’
and ‘as’ for pattern matching. My main concern on ‘is’ and ‘as’ is that
it’s introducing plenty of cascading rules, potentially making it
difficult to distinguish dynamic or static casts, which is particularly
problematic under dependent contexts. The working group reached no
consensus on whether we want such a feature.</p>
<h2 id="contracts">Contracts</h2>
<p><a href="https://wg21.link/p2900r11">P2900R11</a>: Contracts for C++
is a much requested language feature for safety critical application.
The EWG reserved a day and a half to discuss contracts and make a
decision on whether Contracts should be included in C++26. The notion of
safety in contracts is different from UB safety. In short, the current
status of P2900 allows users to define dynamic assertions as
preconditions and postconditions on function parameters as well as using
contract assertion statements within a function body. A brief example
can be found on section 2.2 of the paper. Although the group voted to
forward this paper for library and wording review, the consensus for the
current design is weak. There are major objections around multiple
aspects of the design.</p>
<ul>
<li>UB during contract evaluation: there are strong objections to
allowing all expressions in contracts predicate due to UB safety issues.
However, the trade off might be the expressibility of the contract.</li>
<li>Constification: Values used in contract predicate are <em>implicitly
const l-values</em> to prevent bugs caused by <em>unintentional
modifications of entities outside the predicate</em>. (Note: text in
<em>italics</em> are quotes from paper, cr to original author) It was
quite a debate in the room. Supporting parties have attempted to convert
certain open source projects (including LLVM) to contract assertions and
a large majority (&gt;98%) are free of issues. The remaining bits
included fixing bugs where existing assertion code had side
effects.</li>
<li>Limited customization for contract violation handling.</li>
</ul>
<p>An alternative proposal for what’s called a conveyor function would
like to limit what expression you can put into the predicate and hence
address UB and the motivation of constification. This, on the other
hand, makes contracts much less powerful. P2900 and its competing papers
Since the consensus is weak we will likely see objections later on in
the process.</p>
<h2 id="profiles">Profiles</h2>
<p>Herb Sutter presented <a href="https://wg21.link/p3081">P3081</a>:
<em>Core safety Profiles: Specification, adoptability, and impact</em>
to EWG on Friday Morning. Profiles has been a popular topic among folks
who cite the <a
href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Final-ONCD-Technical-Report.pdf">February
White House paper</a> on the recommendation of Programming Languages.
There was also a discussion referred to a post by Chandler Carruth about
how Google <a
href="https://chandlerc.blog/posts/2024/11/story-time-bounds-checking/">enabled
bounds checking with minimal overhead</a>. While I am in support for
safety and security, I voiced my concerns about how diverging perception
of safety can be harmful. If we are on our way to convince the US
government about C++ being safe (or safer now,) we might be sending the
wrong message to the developers who may start to treat memory safety
less seriously. Since we have only seen a published version of this
paper a bit over a month ago, time for inclusion to C++26 is limited.
The committee reached consensus to make a policy exception for Profiles
to be reviewed again in Hagenberg in February for potential inclusion to
C++26, despite its simultaneous language and library impact.</p>
<h2 id="fun-stuff">Fun Stuff</h2>
<p>On Thursday afternoon, JF Bastien presented <a
href="https://wg21.link/p3477">P3477</a>: <em>There are exactly 8 bits
in a byte</em>. This paper had seen hot internet engagement before the
meeting and made us aware of many exotic architectures. In the end, we
forwarded this paper to CWG for inclusion in C++26 with consensus.</p>
<h2 id="final-words">Final Words</h2>
<p>Overall, it’s an overwhelmingly positive experience to meet with the
other 144 committee members who attended in person. It’s a good reminder
to all of us that different interests and strong opinions occur based on
the vastly different backgrounds of committee members. We may not agree
with one another but with our enthusiasm, the collective goal is to make
C++ experience better over time for millions. Personally, it’s an
opportunity for growth in my comfort zone and practicing technical trade
off discussions at high stakes.</p>
